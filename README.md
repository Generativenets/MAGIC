# MAGIC

MAGIC(Model-agnostic Efficient Graph Inference) is a model agnostic efficient inference method for nodes on an updated graph.

## Application Scenario

When nodes on graph $G_{t}$ is equipped with node embedding, and $G_{t}$ is updated to $G_{t+1}$, we can use MAGIC to generate embedding for nodes on $G_{t+1}$.
